<p>As a UK citizen, you have many representatives, at several levels of government. </p>
<p>Each of them has a different set of responsibilities, and it is worth making sure that your message goes to the person who is best placed to help you.</p>

<h2>When should I contact a councillor?</h2>

<p>Councillors have differing responsibilities depending on which council you
live in. Because of these variations we are only able to give you
‘rule-of-thumb’ guidance here.</p>

<p>Firstly, in England you may have two levels of council: County and District, in
which case their responsibilities are divided as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>District Councillors:</strong> If you have one or more District Councillor,
they tend to deal with issues around <strong>council housing, planning, rubbish
collection, the local environment, and the administration of
elections.</strong></li>
<li><strong>County Councillors:</strong> If you have one or more county councillors, they
tend to deal with <strong>education, transport and roads, fire and social services
plus libraries</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, you will have only one council, whose responsibilities differ
depending on exactly where you live. We describe these on the page which lists
your councillors.</p>

<p>Don’t worry if you’re not absolutely sure who to pick! Whoever you write to
should forward your letter to the most appropriate person, if you haven’t got it quite right.</p>

<A NAME="mep"></A>
<h2>When should I contact an MEP?</h2>

<p>If you have a question about proposed European directives (laws), the
European Parliament, Commission or Union, your MEPs may be able to help.</p>

<p>Once passed, EU laws become the responsibility of national governments and
parliaments to implement, so you may wish to contact your MP about them in
that case.</p>

<p>In addition, and for all EU matters, the European Commission and Parliament
also have specific Information Offices within the UK &ndash;
<a href="http://www.europarl.org.uk/">www.europarl.org.uk</a> and
<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom">ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom</a>. If you have an enquiry, rather than a problem, they are a good place to start.</p>

<p>Note that MEPs cannot help raise an issue with the European Court of Human Rights.
The Convention is incorporated into UK law, so any challenge must start in the UK legal
system.</p>
