<?= $pd->text(_('Councillors have differing responsibilities depending on which council you
live in. Because of these variations we are only able to give you
‘rule-of-thumb’ guidance here.

Firstly, in England you may have two levels of council: County and District, in
which case their responsibilities are divided as follows:

<ul>
<li><strong>District Councillors:</strong> If you have one or more District Councillor,
they tend to deal with issues around <strong>council housing, planning, rubbish
collection, the local environment, and the administration of
elections.</strong></li>
<li><strong>County Councillors:</strong> If you have one or more county councillors, they
tend to deal with <strong>education, transport and roads, fire and social services
plus libraries</strong>.</li>
</ul>

Otherwise, you will have only one council, whose responsibilities differ
depending on exactly where you live. We describe these on the page which lists
your councillors.

Don’t worry if you’re not absolutely sure who to pick! Whoever you write to
should forward your letter to the most appropriate person, if you haven’t got it quite right.')) ?>
