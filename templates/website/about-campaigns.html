<?= $pd->text(_('Are you part of a campaigning organisation? If you ever ask your supporters to write to politicians, you should know that WriteToThem can be integrated into your website simply, and for free.

All your supporters need do is input their postcode and compose their message, then we send it off to the correct representative. 

There are several different options when it comes to using WriteToThem for your campaign. But before we get onto that, a quick word about how WriteToThem <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be used.

<ul>
<li> WriteToThem is <b>not a petitioning site</b>. If you need to collect signatures on a petition and then send it to an MP, you&rsquo;d be better off with one of the many free online petition websites. </li>

<li>We <b>don’t give out MPs’ contact details</b>. Direct email and postal addresses for most MPs can be found on
<a href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/">Parliament’s website</a> or via the
<a href="http://everypolitician.org/">EveryPolitician</a> project.</a>.</li>

<li>WriteToThem cannot be used for sending out <b>identically-worded messages</b> from multiple supporters - our system will detect them and block them from being sent.</li>
</ul>

Before making the decision to use WriteToThem for your campaign, we&rsquo;d urge you to <a href="/about-guidelines">read our guidelines</a>, and make sure that it fits your needs.

With that said, we&rsquo;re more than happy to provide a free service for campaign groups to encourage people to write to their representatives on a particular issue, and there are a number of ways that you can integrate the WriteToThem experience with your campaign.')) ?>

This link can also be modified, so that WriteToThem only presents one specific type of representative: <a href="/about-linktous#types">read more here</a>.

If you are sending out newsletters, you can even pre-fill the name, email and address fields of your supporters&rsquo; letters to their representative: <a href="/about-linktous#prefill">read more about that here</a>.')) ?>
