<p>Are you part of a campaigning organisation? If you ever ask your supporters to write to politicians, you should know that WriteToThem can be integrated into your website simply, and for free.</p>
<p>All your supporters need do is input their postcode and compose their message, then we send it off to the correct representative. </p>
<p> There are several different options when it comes to using WriteToThem for your campaign. But before we get onto that, a quick word about how WriteToThem <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be used.</p>

<ul>
<li> WriteToThem is <b>not a petitioning site</b>. If you need to collect signatures on a petition and then send it to an MP, you'd be better off with one of the many free online petition websites. </li>

<li> We <b>can't give out MPs&rsquo; contact details</b>. Direct email and postal addresses for most MPs can be found on <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/">Parliament&rsquo;s website</a>.</li>

<li>WriteToThem cannot be used for sending out <b>identically-worded messages</b> from multiple supporters - our system will detect them and block them from being sent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before making the decision to use WriteToThem for your campaign, we'd urge you to <a href="/about-guidelines">read our guidelines</a>, and make sure that it fits your needs.</p>

<p>With that said, we&rsquo;re more than happy to provide a free service for campaign groups to encourage people to write to their representatives on a particular issue, and there are a number of ways that you can integrate the WriteToThem experience with your campaign.</p>

<H2>A simple link</H2>
<p>You don't need any technical expertise to provide your supporters with the link to www.WriteToThem.com.</p>

<p>This link can also be modified, so that WriteToThem only presents one specific type of representative: <a href="/about-linktous#types">read more here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are sending out newsletters, you can even pre-fill the name, email and address fields of your supporters' letters to their representative: <a href="/about-linktous#prefill">read more about that here</a>.</p>

<H2>A  fancier link</H2>
<p><a href="/about-linktous#envelope">Here&rsquo;s how to put a nifty little box on your site</a>:  when your users enter their postcode, they'll be taken to WriteToThem to send a message to their MP.</p>

<H2>Wordpress widget</H2>

<p>Thereâ€™s a very simple way to include WriteToThem on a WordPress site: <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/writetothem/" target="_blank">through this plug-in</a>. Installing it is just a matter of drag and drop.</p>

<H2>Using our code to make your own web page</H2>

<p>For a more seamless experience, you might want to <a href="/about-branded">create a branded webpage for your campaign</a>, and there&rsquo;s code available to help you do that. </p>

<p>You will need only a little technical knowledge to install it, and there are step-by-step instructions.</p>
