        <p>Sorry, but please read <a href="/about-qa#onlyrep">this</a> to understand
            why our site only lets you write to <em>your own elected representatives</em>,
            not those for other parts of the country.</p>

        <p>If we didn't do this, then representatives would be snowed under with mail
            from all and sundry, and that would mean they ignored the important mail from
            their own constituents. They might even bin <strong>all</strong> messages
            sent via WriteToThem.com.</p>

        <p>Either of which would be A Bad Thing.</p>

        <p>If somebody else suggested that you do this to get their message across, you
            might want to let them know potentially sabotaged their own campaign too.
            Perhaps you might ask them to read the
            <a href="/about-guidelines">instructions</a> on the site next time?</p>

        <p>If you wish to send a message, please <a href="/">start again from the
            beginning</a> and give only your own, real address and postcode when asked.</p>
