        <p>Sorry, but we have to limit the number of similar messages sent to members
            of the House of Lords, as they have told us they simply disregard
            more than a handful messages of substantially identical content arriving
            within a couple of days. The Parliament website gives <a
            href="http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/members/lords_contact.cfm">
            details of how to send mailshots to all Lords by post</a>.</p>
