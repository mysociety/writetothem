<p><strong>New:</strong> read our
<a href="http://www.mysociety.org/?p=120">detailed rebuttal</a> of
Mr&nbsp;Liddell-Grainger's claims. We have also added our original email to him
querying his activities to this page.</p>

<p>mySociety is not awarding a ranking to Ian Liddell-Grainger MP because
he tried to improve his responsiveness statistics by sending himself
messages.</p>

<p>We could go into lots of detail about the automated detection
mechanisms we put in place once we spotted what was going on, but it
is easier simply to print his own admission.</p>

<p>We sent Mr Liddell-Grainger the following email:</p>

Dear Ian,
        I'm from the team which is building WriteToThem.com, the successor to
FaxYourMP.com. We've just noticed that you've been trying to send a
message to yourself, using our service. Is there anything about the
service we could help explain, or any questions you'd like answering?

all the best,

Tom Steinberg

Tom

We have over the past years replied to every Fax we have had.

Yet my figures are very low. It is being used by an opponent to damage
my standing.

I have had not other complaints in the Constituency.

It would be fine if I had not been replying. <strong><em>If it takes me to help
myself I am sure you understand why</em></strong>.

Ian

<p>For context: 62 survey responses had said that they had
not heard back from him in the 2002-2004 period, against 57 positives.</p>
