            <p>Between 2001 and 2004 our predecessor FaxYourMP.com published a league
                table of MP responsiveness data, measuring
                the proportion of users who said that they had heard something back
                from their MP after they had written to them.</p>

            <p>In 2005 <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> held off publishing an updated version of this data
                because we were busy totally rebuilding FaxYourMP as <a href="/">WriteToThem</a>,
                adding all the UK’s 20,000+ other elected representatives, such as
                councillors and MSPs.</p>

            <p><b>Note:</b> During the period up to a General Election there are
                no MPs, by electoral law.  We disabled WriteToThem’s facility for writing to
                MPs on 14th April, enabling it again a week after the election on 12th May.</p>

            <p>For the 2015&ndash;16 league table, we counted messages sent in the 12 months following the General Election on 7th May 2015.</p>

                messages to elected representatives (and Lords) in the year <?= $values['year'] == '2015' ? '2015&ndash;16' : $values['year'] ?>.</p>

            <p>This included <strong><?=number_format($info['total_dispatched_success']) ?></strong>
                messages to MPs, and <strong><?=number_format($info['non_mp_sent']) ?></strong> to other elected representatives.</p>

            <p>
                <strong><?=number_format($info['total_responded_outof']) ?></strong> people answered our feedback survey
                about communicating with their MP in <?=$values['year']?>.</p>
                <?php if ($values['year'] < 2006) { ?>
                    This asked whether MPs had responded to their message within 2 to 3 weeks.
                <?php } else if ($values['year'] >= 2006) { ?>
                    <p>The survey asked whether people had had <strong>a reply (not just an acknowledgement)</strong> from their
                    representative.
                    <?php if ($values['year'] == 2006) { ?>
                        (Actually the text of the survey changed slightly in both March and April 2006. You
                        can <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/writetothem/blob/master/templates/emails/questionnaire">see in our
                        source code repository</a> when this happened, and what changed).
                    <?php } ?>
                <?php } ?>
                </p>

            <p>People were surveyed initially <strong>after 2 weeks</strong>, and if they
                didn't answer, were surveyed again <strong>after 3 weeks</strong>. Because of
                this, and because of the way different people interpret the survey, you should
                interpret the WriteToThem Zeitgeist figures with caution.</p>

            <p>Also, comparing percentage response rates can be misleading: if you are planning
            to do so, please read more about that on <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2006/02/20/117/">our blog</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Journalists:</strong> Please feel free to use the data on these pages,
                but if you do you <strong>must cite WriteToThem.com</strong> in the body of
                your articles as the source of any analysis or data you get from this site.
                Statistics without a referenced source are dangerous, so please do this.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> While some MPs are very slow at responding to
                constituents mail, that doesn't mean they aren't otherwise active in or around
                Parliament on behalf of their constituents. You can see MPs voting record,
                committee memberships and interests on their <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou</a> page.</p>

            <p>Overall, according to our users’ survey responses, MPs were 2% less
                responsive to constituents’ messages sent via WriteToThem in 2006 compared to in
                2005. This is partly because of a sharp drop in the number of MPs getting those
                near-perfect scores of 90% or higher responsiveness. On the other hand,
                far fewer MPs have woeful response rates less than 20%.

            <h3 id="deprivation">Do only the better off use WriteToThem?</h3>

            <p>Sometimes people have told us that websites like WriteToThem only help
                people who are already better off in society, because they have better access
                to computers.  One of our volunteers, Sam Smith, has tested this and found that
                people from deprived areas use WriteToThem as much or more than people
                from better off areas. You can read his full paper on the subject here.</p>

                response rates (below 20%) and also fewer with tip top scores
                (above 80%). Unfortunately, the now fatter bump in the middle has
