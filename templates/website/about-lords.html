<dt>Who should I write to?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Think about an issue you care about. Then enter it into the box as a
word or a phrase. We'll show you a list of the Lords who speak most on
that issue.</p>
<p>Don't just pick the top Lord: read a bit about what they've said. If
they're a minister they'll probably be very hard to persuade, so you
probably want to pick someone who's not working directly for the
Government.</p>
<p>Or, if you just want to tell a lord about an issue that they don't
know about, hit the Random Lord button.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Why Write To Your Lord?</dt>

<dd><p>Well, they may not be elected, but they still get to vote on and
amend all sorts of bills that affect us all every day when they become law.
By writing to a
lord you might be able to tell them about something you think they
should care about, provide information to someone who you support, or
provide counter evidence to someone you disagree with.</p></dd>

<dt>How does it work? Do you have all the Lords email addresses?</dt>

<dd><p>No. We are just using the House of Lords fax facility.</p></dd>

<dt>How many lords can I write to?</dt>

<dd><p>At first we're limiting correspondance to one message maximum per
person per day. You see, they've only got this one fax machine, and we don't want
to overwhelm it.</p></dd>

<dt>I'm responsible for the House of Lords fax machine. Can we talk?</dt>

<dd><p>Certainly - drop us an email to <a href="mailto:team&#64;writetothem.com">team&#64;writetothem.com</a>.</p></dd>

<dt>Why should a Lord bother replying to my message?</dt>

<dd><p>Because we believe that most politicians are actually decent people
trying to do their best. But if relying on people to do the decent
thing doesn't work, there are always <a
href="http://www.writetothem.com/stats/2005/mps">other forms of
encouragement</a>.</p></dd>

<dt>What, do you mean you're going to publish league tables of Lords'
responsiveness?</dt>

<dd><p>As standard, we gather data on the responsiveness of all
representatives contacted via our service. We'll be doing the same for
peers.</p></dd>

<dt>Do you have a Lords reform agenda? What do you think about an elected reform?</dt>

<dd><p>Hah! Like we've got time to think about things like that with
<a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">all</a>
<a href="http://www.hearfromyourmp.com/">these</a>
<a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/">pesky</a>

<dt><a name="when"></a>
When should I write to a Lord, instead of, say, my MP?</dt>

<dd><p>There are various reasons you might want to write to a Lord. They
may be passionately involved with an issue you care about, or you
might disagree with them on an issue that they speak about publicly.
Often you might find that a Bill containing something you care about
has been passed from the Commons to the Lords for debate, amendment or
approval. Or, of course, you might just want to ask them what they do,
or what they think about something. Whatever: they're your Lords.</p></dd>

<dt>This is ace - how can I help you guys?</dt>

<dd><p>Easy - <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/volunteertasks">become a
volunteer</a>!</p></dd>
