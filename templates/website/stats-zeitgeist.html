<? if ($values['year'] == '2005') { ?>
<p>Between 2001 and 2004 our predecessor FaxYourMP.com published a league
table of MP responsiveness data, measuring
the proportion of users who said that they had heard something back
from their MP after they had written to them.</p>
<p>In 2005 <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> held off publishing an updated version of this data
because we were busy totally rebuilding FaxYourMP as <a href="/">WriteToThem</a>,
adding all the UK's 20,000+ other elected representatives, such as
councillors and MSPs.</p>
<p>We are now publishing this data to celebrate WriteToThem's first
birthday, and to fulfil our parent charity's registered objects &mdash; to
conduct research into the interaction between elected bodies and the
Internet.</p>
<h3>Messages to MPs during 2005</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> During the period up to a General Election there are
no MPs, by electoral law.  We disabled WriteToThem's facility for writing to
MPs on 14th April, enabling it again a week after the election on 12th May.</p>

<h3>Messages sent by deprivation level</h3>
<p>Sometimes people say that websites like WriteToThem only help people who are
already better off in society, because they have better access to
computers. One of our volunteers, Sam Smith, has tested this and found that
people from deprived areas actually use WriteToThem more than people from
better off areas.</p>

<p>This chart shows how many messages were sent by users, organised by a
deprivation index of the electoral ward that they live in. Each user was put in
one of five different 'quintiles' according to whether they are in the most
deprived fifth of wards, next most deprived fifth and so on. The chart shows
how many of our users were from each derivation 'quintile'. You can see that
more than a fifth (20%) of our users come from the most deprived fifth of wards. 
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="/stats/deprivation-2006-WMC.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The chart includes all users who wrote a letter to send to
their MP using WriteToThem during 2006. For more details on the methodology
behind this researc, see Sam Smith's paper TODO add link.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Very few messages were sent to some MPs and parties.
Because we have only a limited amount of data in each case, we cannot be certain
of their responsiveness. The ranges show the '95% <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a>' for each
responsiveness; the larger the range, the less certain we are. We believe
that it is 95% certain that the true values lie between the two limits of the
confidence intervals. You can read <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/?p=117">more discussion of this and other details of the stats</a> by one of our developers.</p>
