        <?php if ($values['year'] == '2005'): ?>
            <p>Between 2001 and 2004 our predecessor FaxYourMP.com published a league
                table of MP responsiveness data, measuring
                the proportion of users who said that they had heard something back
                from their MP after they had written to them.</p>

            <p>In 2005 <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> held off publishing an updated version of this data
                because we were busy totally rebuilding FaxYourMP as <a href="/">WriteToThem</a>,
                adding all the UK's 20,000+ other elected representatives, such as
                councillors and MSPs.</p>

            <p>We are now publishing this data to celebrate WriteToThem's first
                birthday, and to fulfil our parent charity's registered objects &mdash; to
                conduct research into the interaction between elected bodies and the
                Internet.</p>

            <h3 id="responsehistogram">Did MPs do better this year or last year?</h3>

            <p>Overall, according to our users' survey responses, MPs were 2% less
                responsive to constituents' messages sent via WriteToThem in 2006 compared to in
                2005. This is partly because of a sharp drop in the number of MPs getting those
                near-perfect scores of 90% or higher responsiveness. On the other hand,
                far fewer MPs have woeful response rates less than 20%.

            <h3 id="deprivation">Do only the better off use WriteToThem?</h3>

            <p>Sometimes people have told us that websites like WriteToThem only help
                people who are already better off in society, because they have better access
                to computers.  One of our volunteers, Sam Smith, has tested this and found that
                people from deprived areas use WriteToThem as much or more than people
                from better off areas. You can read his full paper on the subject here.</p>

            <p>Overall, according to our users' survey responses, MPs were 1% less
                responsive to constituents' messages sent via WriteToThem in 2007 compared to in
                2006. Once again MPs have moved to the middle - there are slightly fewer MPs with dire
                response rates (below 20%) and also fewer with tip top scores
                (above 80%). Unfortunately, the now fatter bump in the middle has
                shifted leftwards a bit, meaning more MPs are scoring below 50% than last
                year.
