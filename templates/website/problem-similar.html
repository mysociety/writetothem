        <p>Please read <a href="/about-qa#formletters">our stance on this issue</a>
            to understand why sending identikit "copied and pasted" messages
            is detrimental to your campaign.</p>

        <p>Sorry to be so harsh, but representatives have made it clear that the
            receipt of such fax "spam" could mean they bin <strong>all</strong> messages
            sent via WriteToThem.com.</p>

        <p>Which would be A Bad Thing.</p>

        <p>You might like to let the person who asked you to do this know that they've
            potentially sabotaged their own campaign too. Point them to our <a
            href="/about-guidelines">Guidelines for campaigning</a>.</p>

        <p>If you wish to rewrite your message, use the "back" button in your browser and
            write it in your own, original, words. It's better to send a short message
            in your own words, than a long, mainly copy-and-pasted message with a
            few amendments.</p>
