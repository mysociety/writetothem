<h2>Guidelines for campaigning</h2>

<p>If you're encouraging people to use WriteToThem.com to talk to their representatives about
a particular issue, there are some particularly important points to keep in
mind. Note that most of these are essential, not just handy hints: wilfully 
ignoring them will be construed as an abuse of our service, and will automatically
trigger filters which will 'freeze' your messages. Plus, the only effect it'll have on representatives is annoying them and that won't do your 
campaign any good.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Do not give people text to paste into their messages.</strong><br>
Spamming lots of representatives with near-identical messages is definitely bad
behaviour in our book.  Please be aware that if you do this, most of the duplicate messages will be filtered out automatically and will never get to the representatives. We will let all the people who sent identikit messages know that their messages have been blocked, and we will tell them that it is because you broke our terms and conditions. All you will achieve is irritation amongst your own supporters.
(<a href="/about-qa#formletters">More information</a>.) Instead, provide a short list of points which people should address in their own words. Messages written by individuals will never be blocked by our systems unless they are clearly abusive or break our conditions of use.</li>

<li><strong>Don't spam people either.</strong><br>
If you're gathering the troops by email, only gather those who have already
committed to your cause. In the past, we've seen people using professional
spammers (sorry, "email marketers") to get the word out. Once again, this kind
of practice is only going to irritate people. We don't want to
be associated with that kind of behaviour, thankyouverymuch.</li>

<li><strong>Don't supply people with a postcode to use.</strong><br>
People should be writing to their <em>own</em> representatives, not anyone else's. Otherwise
one poor representative will end up with a whole load of messages and the others, who may
have been able to help, will get none. <a href="/about-qa#onlyrep">More information</a>.</li>

<li><strong>If you're talking to an international audience, stress that only
people living in the UK should use our service.</strong><br>
We've seen too many large campaigns that have inadvertently encouraged
non-UK residents to dig up a UK address to use as their own when contacting a
representative.</li>

<li><strong>If you're talking to a <em>very</em> large audience, please try to
	<a href="/about-contact">let us know</a> in advance.</strong><br>
If you're going to mention WriteToThem.com in a campaign which reaches tens of
thousands of people at once, <em>please</em> let us know first! If our servers
can't cope, it breaks your campaign. With a few days notice, we can make this
much less likely.</li>

<li><strong>Be considerate.</strong><br>
By now, the common pattern to the above guidelines should be clear: If you
irritate representatives, users or us, you're not helping anyone. </li>
