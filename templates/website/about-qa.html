If we published all the addresses, we wouldn’t be able to ensure that users were writing to the representatives who were actually permitted to help them.
<li>The WritetoThem system monitors - as best we can - whether the emails get to their destination. This means we can fix bad contact details, rather than leaving them not working.</li>
<li>We check whether users receive a reply, and <a href="https://www.writetothem.com/stats/">hold representatives to account</a> if they never respond.</li>

It’s easy enough to find your MP’s email address if you happen to know who
he or she is, but 78% of the UK population cannot name their representative in
Parliament (figure comes from the <a href="https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/projects/audit-of-political-engagement">Hansard Society Audit of Public Engagement 2013</a> [PDF]).

If you know you want to write to someone in power, but you have no idea how to, then we hope that WriteToThem removes that barrier.

Similarly, you might think it is relatively easy to visit your council website and discover who your local councillors are. We’d say that it depends on the council website. In <em>some</em> cases, it’s a wee bit easier to put your postcode into WriteToThem’s homepage.')) ?>

Additionally, you may not use WriteToThem for sending messages that are abusive or threatening.

You should not use the service to bombard a representative with several messages over a short period of time.

On discovery of such usage we may, at our discretion, ban you from further use of WriteToThem.

As with all mySociety services and activities, users of WriteToThem must abide by the organisation&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
This code applies to all activity related to the service, including correspondence with mySociety staff.

Where a user sends a message that is intended to harass, threaten, abuse or distress a member of mySociety staff,
we will, at our discretion, cease communication. We may also ban the correspondent from future use of the site.

Where a message is of particular concern, we will forward details of the correspondence to the police.')) ?>
