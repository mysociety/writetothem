<dt><a name="how"></a>How do I send a message?</dt>

<dd>

<p>To send your free message, just go to the home page of the site, type in
your postcode and press the "Go" button. Up will pop details of all your elected
representatives. Select the one you want, and you will be taken straight to a
simple form in which you can start writing your message straight away. Don't
forget to fill in your name, address and email &mdash; we can't send your
message without these.</p>

<p>When you have finished writing your message, press the "Preview your
message" button at the bottom of this page. Take a look to see if you have
expressed yourself as well as you want to. If not, you can click on "edit this
Message" to go back to the original form, and change your letter. Otherwise,
click on the "Continue" button to start the process of sending your letter.</p>

<p>Before WriteToThem sends your message to your chosen representative,
there has to be a simple fourth step. We send you an email, as a way of
confirming that you are a real person. The message contains a link (a website
address) which you must visit before we can send your message. If the email
cannot be sent for whatever reason, your message will not be sent. If the email
goes unanswered, your message will not be sent. For these reasons, make sure
you type in your email address correctly on the form. <strong>The email we send
you also contains a copy of your own letter for your future
reference.</strong></p>

<p>There is no need to write anything in response to the mail we send &mdash;
just click on the link, or copy and paste it in to your browser window and
that's it. Message sent.</p>

<p>If you would like a reply to your letter, don't forget to ask for one when
composing your message. It's up to the representative in question to get in
touch with you.</p>

<p>Two weeks after your message has been sent, we will email you again asking
if your representative has been in touch. WriteToThem cannot be held
responsible for any representative's failure get in touch, but we think it
worthwhile to track their responsiveness. You can see the
<a href="/stats/">statistics we make from this</a>.</p>

<p>WriteToThem would like to say again that while we are offering this site
as a service to the public, we can't guarantee to anyone that your
representative will read the message you send, and we can't follow up any
enquiries you make regarding any replies from your representative.</p>

<p>If you are not a broadband user, or if you pay for your internet connection
per minute, you can go offline  to save yourself a bit of cash whilst you
compose your letter. Write the letter you wish to send in the word processing
program you use every day, then when you are happy with it, dial in to your ISP
again and just copy and paste your letter into the message form. The form will
also ask you for your full name, address and email address. These personal
details are to verify who you are, and to allow your representative to reply to
you.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p> </dd>

<dt><a name="address"></a>Why do you want my address, name, email address and
phone?</dt> <dd> <ul> <li>Firstly to enable your chosen elected representative
to get in touch with you, and to help the message that is sent look more like a
formal letter.  Note that entering your phone number is optional, but
advisable. Sometimes representatives would rather call you than write back to
you.</li> <li>Secondly, to enable us to send you a copy of your message for
your records, and to tell you if there was a delivery problem. </li>
<li>Thirdly, to enable you to confirm who you are, and that you live in a
particular area.  WriteToThem is concerned that this service is used in a
responsible way by everyone.  Which is why we built it responsibly.  </li>

<dt><a name="ministers"></a>Why can't I write to a Minister through the
site?</dt>

<dd><p><a href="http://www.writetothem.com">Super</a> <a

href="http://www.fixmystreet.com">though</a> <a
href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">we</a> <a
href="http://www.hearfromyourmp.com">are</a>, we can't do everything. A few
people have talked about making a "Write to a Minister" website, but it hasn't
happened yet. Contact us if you would like to fund such a site. For now,
WriteToThem concentrates on being a way for you to contact your elected
representatives. If your MP happens to also be a Minister, you can still of course
contact them using WriteToThem. Please do not try to write to a Minister
who is not your MP using WriteToThem, as your message may go to their
constituency office as an MP, which would not be the right place to handle it.

<p>Anyway, Ministers are often best contacted via your MP.  To do this, ask
your MP to pass on your concern to the relevant Minister.  They will do this
even if they disagree with you, although you should ask them to add their own
support if they do agree with you. Your MP will return the response that they
get from the Minister.  If necessary, your MP can also chase the Minister, on
your behalf, through Questions in Parliament.

<p>If you would like to contact a Minister directly, you may find a list of
their contact details on this <a

departments and ministers on the Parliament web site</a>.</p>

<dt><a name="noreply"></a>What should I do if my MP (or other representative)
doesn't reply?</dt>

<dd>
<p>There are lots of things you can do to follow up your enquiry if you get no
reply, or an unsatisfactory reply, from your representative.</p>

<ul>

<li>See your MP or other representative in person, raise your issue with them
at their local "surgery".  Call your MP's local constituency office or your
representative's party office to arrange this. You can find the number in your
local phone book, or on your MP's website.

<li>Make sure you have taken all other courses of action to raise your issue,
or to get your problem solved. For example, contact the relevant central
Government department, and relevant officers at your local councils. Ask your
local Citizens Advice Bureau for advice.

<li> Write a letter to your local newspaper about your issue, and your
dissatisfaction with your MP, MEP or councillor.

<li> Write a letter to your other representatives, such as your MP, your local
councillors, MEPs or regional representatives, if appropriate. You can do this
for free using <a href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem</a>.

<li> Complain about your representative to their local party. Contact the local
party office. The local party has the power not to select your MP as a
candidate for the next General Election.

<li> Use <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com">PledgeBank</a> (made by
the same charity that makes WriteToThem) to gather a group of people with
the same issue as you, and solve the problem together.

<dt><a name="digitalsig"></a>There's a statement about signatures at the bottom
of my message. What's that about?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Way back in the early days of FaxYourMP.com, a small group of MPs started
replying to constituents who used the service, saying that they could not
possibly respond to unsigned messages. Because FaxYourMP messages weren't
signed, the MPs couldn't be sure that they were genuine. The constituents were
asked to resubmit their request on paper.</p>

<p>This was a bit confusing to the FaxYourMP team. In practical terms, a
written signature proves nothing: in order to check the veracity of the letter
or signature, you'd have to check it with the original author to get a
confirmatory sample of their signature &mdash; and if you were doing that, why didn't
you just <em>ask</em> them about the letter?  It made no sense.</p>

<p>Then they thought: aha, perhaps this is some <em>legal</em> requirement.  A
lot of MPs are lawyers, and are probably very good about this kind of thing.
Perhaps even better than they are at simply answering constituents'
requests.</p>

<p>Happily, if it's legality they're worried about, there is a fix.  The
<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/7/section/7">Electronic
Communications Act 2000, Subsection 7(3)</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7(3) For the purposes of this section an electronic signature incorporated
into or associated with a particular electronic communication or particular
electronic data is certified by any person if that person (whether before or
after the making of the communication) has made a statement confirming
that--</p>

<p>(a) the signature,</p>
<p>(b) a means of producing, communicating or verifying the signature, or</p>
<p>(c) a procedure applied to the signature,</p>

<p>is (either alone or in combination with other factors) a valid means of
establishing the authenticity of the communication or data, the integrity of
the communication or data, or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The message at the bottom of your message is your statement to that effect.
For the purpose of sending a letter to your representative, your electronic
signature is legally valid. You may point this out to your representative
should they tell you that they can't reply to your message, because they don't
know who you are.</p>

<p>And what does the strange '0c0c38720cde084343' bit signify?</p>

<p>It's a SHA1 hash of your e-mail address. Very impressive to overly
legalistic MPs. Highly technical.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="checkmessage"></a>Can I check the message before I send it?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Yes. There is every chance to take a second look and make sure you said what
you wanted to say. Just click on "Preview" before you send the message, and you
can see the whole thing nicely formatted.</p>

<p>Check through it, and if you see anything you don't like, just click
on <b>"&lt;&lt;edit this Message"</b>.</p>

<p>It will take you straight back to the form, where you will be able to delete
or add anything you want. There is no limit to the amount of times you can
preview and edit.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="howsitsent"></a>How are messages sent to all the councillors, MPs etc.?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Most messages are sent directly to representatives' official email
addresses. However, many more are faxed. Furthermore, we may fax messages to
representatives who do not appear to be actively checking their email. Many
representatives have paper-based filing systems, and find it much easier to
deal with faxed messages than emails.</p>

<p>For messages to local councillors we will usually send your message to the
democratic or members' services offices of that council, who will then forward
it on to the right person. We would appreciate any help from volunteers with
the huge task of entering many more of the direct email and fax details for
councillors, normally found on council websites.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="guarantee"></a>Can you guarantee my message will be sent?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Sadly, no. We have more than 24,000 representives in our database, and
whilst <a href="http://www.goveval.com/">GovEval</a> help us keep them up to
date, there will be some that fall through the gap. We will do everything we
can to spot and eliminate problems though, so please let us know if you have
spotted any gaps. We will, however, do everything we can to tell you if your
message didn't get through.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="directemail">Can't you just give me the direct email address of my MP?</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>There are several reasons we don't use direct email address links.</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't have direct email addresses for all MPs or representatives,
we often send messages by fax.</li>
<li>Quite a few people use computers in public places where the computer
is not set up for their email, so direct email links would not work.
They need a web form to write their message.</li>
<li>We prevent spam, or other abusive mass emailed messages, from being
sent to representatives.</li>
<li>We monitor as best we can whether the emails/faxes get there, so we can fix
bad contact details, rather than leaving them not working.</li>
<li>We send a questionnaire to hold representatives to account if they
never reply.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can sometimes find direct email address for your MP on the Guardian's
<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/aristotle/">Ask Aristotle</a> site,
or on the <a href="http://findyourmp.parliament.uk/">Parliament website</a>.</p>

</dd>

<dt><a name="cancelmsg"></a>How do I cancel my message?</dt>

<dd>
<p>If you would like to cancel your message and <strong>not</strong> send it,
please just do <em>not</em> click on the link in the confirmation email that
will be sent to you. Once you have confirmed your message by clicking that link,
it will probably have been sent pretty much instantly. Our best advice is to
carefully read your message before confirming it.</p>

<dt><a name="doityourself"></a>I have an idea for a service similar to WriteToThem. How would I set it up? Can I use your software?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Our software is all available on our public CVS and you can use it under the
terms of the GNU Affero GPL "Open Source" licence. There's a link in the copyright
messages at the bottom of every page. Sadly, we have to keep licensed data
(such as the links between postcodes and wards/constituencies, and the names of
representatives) out of the public domain, but there is a huge amount of useful
work available here, especially for people who want to build versions of
WriteToThem in other countries.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask our developers about how the service works! Their email
addresses are in every source file. They'll do their best to answer your
questions, within reason.</p>

in life generally), or you see any error messages.
