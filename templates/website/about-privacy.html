<h2>Privacy and cookies</h2>

<p><strong>Our use of your data, cookies, and external services: what you
should know, and how to opt out if you want to.</strong></p>

<p>Summary: We care a lot about our users’ privacy. We provide details below,
and we try our hardest to look after the private data that we hold. Like many
other websites, we sometimes use cookies and Google Analytics to help us make
our websites better. These tools are very common and used by many other sites,
but they do have privacy implications, and as a charity concerned with socially
positive uses of the internet, we think it’s important to explain them in full.
If you don’t want to share your browsing activities on mySociety’s sites with
other companies, you can adjust your usage or install opt-out browser plugins.

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>This is our privacy policy (sorry it is so long, but it is quite precise):</p>

<ul>

<li>We will pass on your message, name, email and postal address
and (optionally) telephone number either direct to the politician(s)
you write to, or to a trusted intermediary (such as a council
democratic services department) who will then pass it on.
</li>
<li>We will never sell or otherwise distribute any information you give
WriteToThem to organisations or individuals outside of mySociety, except in the
following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>when required to do so by UK law;
<li>if you come to the site via louder.org.uk, we are given a unique ID that we
pass back to them when you confirm your message. If you were logged in to
louder.org.uk, they will know you have <em>sent</em> a message (but nothing else).
<li>from time to time we may participate in research projects with external
bodies, in which case we may share select, anonymous information. We will never
share the content of your messages with these external bodies.
</ul>
</li>
<li> We will store your IP address and the pages that you visited whilst
on the site as part of our site logs. We keep these for one month.
</li>
<li> We will never keep permanent copies of the letters you write to send
to your representatives, and will not look at your messages unless
there is a problem with the operation of the site which requires us
to do so.
</li>
<li>We will store the content of your message for four weeks after it was
dispatched. Then it is automatically deleted. We keep a copy in backup files
for one additional week. We need to keep it for this long to monitor and
prevent abuse of the service. It also means we can include a copy of your
message in the email which asks if your representative has
responded yet.</li>
<li>If delivery of a message fails for a week, we keep the message content for
a further 8 weeks.  This gives us time to diagnose the problem. We sometimes
need the content so we can resend the message.
<li> We keep records of names and addresses for longer periods in order
to provide an audit trail if a representative queries the accuracy of
the statistics on response rates we produce. We will never give these
out to a representative on any other occasion than when you send them
your message.
</li>
<li> If you contact mySociety via our support email address we reserve the
right to keep your support message indefinitely, especially if you say
something nice about us.
</li>
<li>We use cookies to track how people use mySociety sites, and how they
move between them. We do this only to make our sites work better, and in some
cases as part of research projects with external bodies. We will never sell this
information, and will only share it with out research partners in an anonymous
form.</li>
<li> We will never send you unsolicited email except:
a) One survey email and up to one reminder two weeks after you send
your message.
b) In the rare case that a politician asks us to pass a message on their behalf
to survey respondents in their constituency/ward who say they have not heard
back from them.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; many websites do this. We use this information to measure how people use the website so we can improve it and make sure it works properly. Below, we list the cookies and services that this site can use.

<h3>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h3>

We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better. Google Analytics stores information such as what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on, and information about your web browser. IP addresses are masked (only a portion is stored) and personal information is only reported in aggregate. We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data for any purpose besides providing us with analytics information, and we recommend that any user of Google Analytics does the same.

<p>If you’re unhappy with data about your visit to be used in this way, you can install the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">official browser plugin for blocking Google Analytics</a>.

<p>The cookies set by Google Analytics are as follows:

<tr><td>__utma</td><td>Unique anonymous visitor ID</td><td>2 years</td></tr>
<tr><td>__utmb</td><td>Unique anonymous session ID</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>__utmz</td><td>Information on how the site was reached (e.g. direct or via a link/search/advertisement)</td><td>6 months</td></tr>
