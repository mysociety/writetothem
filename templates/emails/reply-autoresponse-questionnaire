This is an automatic response, we have NOT read your email.

If you are trying to complete our questionnaire, you cannot do that by replying
to the email we sent -- instead, you MUST click on one of the links below, or
copy-and-paste it into your web browser.

A few weeks ago we sent your letter to your representative.

- If you HAVE had a reply (not just an acknowledgement), please
click on the link below:

<?=$values['yes_url']?>

- If you HAVE NOT had a reply, or you have only had an acknowledgement, please
click on the link below:

<?=$values['no_url']?>

If you feel that neither link is suitable, then please do not answer the
questionnaire. If you have a question or comment about the site, please send an
email to <?=$values['contact_email']?>
