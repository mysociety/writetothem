Emails sent to constituents by the queue. For consistency we interpret these
and interpret variables like

    <?=$values['name_of_variable']?>

(the superficial similarity to PHP is intentional) but that is the ONLY syntax
supported.

Values which are available in all emails are:

  - recipient_name, the name of the representative to whom the original letter
    was addressed, e.g. "Tony Blair";

  - recipient_position, their position, e.g. "MP";

  - recipient_position_plural, plural form of position, e.g. "MPs";

  - recipient_area_name, their voting area, e.g. "Sedgefield";

  - recipient_id, the ID of the recipient;

  - sender_name, the full name of the sender as they supplied it; and

  - sender_addr, the sender's address, formatted with commas between each line.

The text of each message should be formatted with blank lines between
paragraphs; all text will be filled/wrapped to an appropriate width before
sending.

Emails and the available variables are:

  - confirm
  - confirm-reminder

    Sent to the user to ask them to confirm their email address. Extra variables
    are,

      - confirm_url, the URL which they should click to confirm their address.

    -reminder is the reminder mail, sent one day after the original.

    The text of the constituent's letter is appended to the confirmation mail.
