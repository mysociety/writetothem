"<ul>\n"
"<li>We have safeguards in place to prevent spam, or other abusive mass emailed messages, from being sent to representatives. </li>\n"
"<li>Strict parliamentary protocols mean that MPs can only help their own constituents; for that reason, our system only allows you to write to your own representatives. If we published all the addresses, we wouldn’t be able to ensure that users were writing to the representatives who were actually permitted to help them.\n"
"<li>The WritetoThem system monitors - as best we can - whether the emails get to their destination. This means we can fix bad contact details, rather than leaving them not working.</li>\n"
"<li>We check whether users receive a reply, and <a href=\"https://www.writetothem.com/stats/\">hold representatives to account</a> if they never respond.</li>\n"

"WriteToThem makes it easy for anyone to contact their representatives, even if they don’t know who they are. \n"
"\n"
"If you can’t name your MP, that doesn’t make you unusual. 78% of the UK\n"
"population cannot name their representative in Parliament, according to\n"
"<a href=\"https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/projects/audit-of-political-engagement\">the 2013\n"
"report from the Hansard Society</a> (PDF).\n"
"\n"
"That’s the reason this website exists - but if you’re interested to know a bit more about the whys and wherefores, read on.\n"
"\n"
"<H2>Our history</H2>\n"
"\n"
"The first version of WriteToThem was built in 2004, by a group of volunteers who thought that it should be easier for people to contact their MPs. Does that seem like a long time ago? It’ll seem even longer when you find out that it was, at that point, called FaxYourMP.com.\n"
"\n"
"That group of volunteers later grew into\n"
"<a href=\"https://www.mysociety.org/\">mySociety</a>, the project of a\n"
"<a href=\"https://www.mysociety.org/about/structure-and-governance/\">registered\n"
"charity</a>. \n"
"\n"
"mySociety&rsquo;s mission is to build internet projects which give people simple,\n"
"tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. \n"
"\n"
"Our first project was to take FaxYourMP and rebuild it so that it was bigger and better. As email became more prevalent, we adapted the site to work almost entirely via that form of communication. \n"
"\n"
"We’ve kept on working, adding more types of representative, improving the design - but at its core, WriteToThem has the same mission as its predecessor, FaxYourMP: we just want to lower the barrier to taking the first step, and writing to the people in power about the issues that matter to you.\n"
"\n"
"<H2>Funding</H2>\n"
"\n"
"We had funding for the initial work from the\n"
"<a href=\"http://www.odpm.gov.uk\">Office of the Deputy Prime Minister</a>&rsquo;s\n"
"e-innovations fund, in partnership with\n"
"<a href=\"https://www.westsussex.gov.uk\">West Sussex County Council</a>. Many thanks\n"
"to them.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<a href=\"http://www.goveval.com/\"><img align=\"right\" src=\"images/ge.png\" alt=\"GovEval\" border=\"0\"></a>\n"
"We also receive assistance from <a href=\"http://www.goveval.com/\">GovEval</a>,\n"
"who have kindly made available their database of local councillors; and from\n"
"<a href=\"https://www.mythic-beasts.com/\">Mythic Beasts</a>, who host this and\n"
"other mySociety websites.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Like many mySociety projects, <b>WriteToThem</b> combines the work of some\n"
"core developers, who are paid to keep working even when everyone else gets\n"
"bored, and volunteers. \n"

"\n"
"<blockquote>\n"
"MPs rather naturally take a sudden influx of identical or similar messages\n"
"with a large pinch of salt, since they know that what they are seeing is stuff\n"
"from a minority of constituents who are either impassioned/neurotic about the\n"
"topic concerned or who are easily gulled into agreeing with some plausible\n"
"story and sending the message, since it takes minimum effort to do so.\n"
"\n"
"Given a daily mailbag of (say) 50 individual messages from individual\n"
"constituents, on a wide range of topics, when the mailbag suddenly rises to 100\n"
"a day, 50 of which are much the same as each other, the representative has no\n"
"way at all of knowing whether the message concerned is representative of\n"
"opinion in the constituency.\n"
"\n"
"All he or she knows is that 50 constituents have been persuaded to mail them\n"
"about \"topic X\". Much more notice is taken of trends within the regular flow of\n"
"messages from clearly identified constituents. If in a month 50 people write in\n"
"different ways and through different routes with similar views on a subject,\n"
"this is much more likely to raise the profile of the topic with the MP.\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"\n"
"So please don’t copy and paste the same message as everyone else. And don’t\n"
"encourage others to do so. It’s worse than useless as we’ll automatically stop\n"
